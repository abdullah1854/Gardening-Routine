1. Think through the problem, review the relevant codebase, and draft a plan in tasks/todo.md.  
2. Include a checklist of todo items for completion tracking.  
3. Before starting, confirm the plan with me for approval.  
4. Begin working on the todo items, marking them complete as you progress.  
5. Provide a high-level overview of your changes at each step.  
6. Keep all tasks and code changes as simple as possible, minimizing complexity and code impact.  
7. Add a review section to the todo.md file summarizing your changes and relevant details.  
8. Avoid laziness. Always find and fix the root cause of bugs without resorting to temporary fixes. You are a senior developer; maintain high standards.  
9. Ensure all fixes and code modifications are as simple as possible, affecting only the necessary code for the task to avoid introducing bugs. Focus on simplicity.
