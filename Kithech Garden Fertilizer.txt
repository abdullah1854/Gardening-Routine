Mustard Cake Water
Use it once every 15–20 days for most plants.
Mustard cake is strong, so using it too often can harm plants.
⚖️ How Much to Use
	•	Mix 1 part mustard cake with 4–5 parts water
	•	Soak for 24–48 hours
	•	Strain
	•	Dilute the liquid further:1 cup fertilizer water + 3 cups plain water
🌱 Plants That Love Mustard Cake Fertilizer
Use regularly on:
	•	Flowering plants (rose, hibiscus, marigold, jasmine)
	•	Leafy vegetables (spinach, methi)
	•	Fruiting plants (tomato, brinjal, chillies)
	•	Curry leaf plant
🚫 Avoid Using On
	•	Seedlings (too strong)
	•	Very young plants
	•	Indoor plants in low light (can cause fungus)
⭐ Extra Tips
	•	Use only on wet soil (never on dry soil).
	•	Do not pour too close to the plant stem.
	•	If plants show yellowing or leaf burn, reduce frequency.


Bone Meal
Apply once every 45–60 days (1.5 to 2 months).
Bone meal breaks down slowly and provides nutrients for a long time, so it should not be used frequently.
🌱 Best Way to Use Bone Meal
1. During repotting
	•	Mix 1–2 tablespoons per 8–10 inch pot
	•	Mix into the soil, not on top
2. For existing plants
	•	Make small holes around the plant
	•	Add 1 tablespoon per pot
	•	Cover with soil and water lightly
📌 Plants that Benefit the Most
Bone meal is rich in phosphorus + calcium, good for:
	•	Flowering plants (rose, hibiscus, bougainvillea, marigold)
	•	Fruiting plants (tomato, chillies, brinjal)
	•	Root vegetables (carrot, beetroot, radish)
	•	Bulbs (onion, garlic, tulips, lilies)
🚫 Do NOT use bone meal on
	•	Seedlings
	•	Indoor plants
	•	Plants that prefer acidic soil (e.g., some ferns)
	•	Very small pots (can cause fungus)



Compost / Vermicompost
Apply every 20–25 days.
Unlike mustard cake (strong) and bone meal (slow-release), compost is gentle and can be used more often.
🌱 How Much to Use
For 8–10 inch pots
	•	2–3 handfuls (about 150–200 g)
For 12–14 inch pots
	•	3–4 handfuls (250–300 g)
For Grow bags (12–15 inch)
	•	3–5 handfuls
Always mix it lightly into the top 1–2 inches of soil and water afterwards.
💚 Benefits of Compost/Vermicompost
	•	Improves soil structure
	•	Provides steady nutrients
	•	Helps plant immunity
	•	Makes soil airy and helps roots expand
	•	Encourages beneficial microbes
🚫 Avoid This Mistake
Do not apply compost too deeply or in large lumps—it can attract ants or fungus.Do not use compost that smells bad or looks wet and slimy (not fully decomposed).





Neem Oil
Use neem oil once every 7–10 days as a preventive spray.
If plants already have pests (aphids, mealybugs, whiteflies, spider mites), then use:
➡️ Every 3–4 days for 2 weeks, then stop.
🔥 Correct Neem Oil Mixing Formula
This is the most important part:
Neem Oil Spray Recipe
	•	Neem oil: 5 ml (1 teaspoon)
	•	Liquid soap: 2–3 drops (acts as emulsifier)
	•	Water: 1 liter
Shake well until the solution becomes milky.
🌙 Best Time to Apply
	•	Spray in evening (never morning sunlight)
	•	Covers both sides of leaves
	•	Avoid spraying on flowering buds (can drop them)
📌 Plants That Need Neem Oil Most
	•	Tomato
	•	Chilli
	•	Brinjal
	•	Roses
	•	Curry leaf
	•	Hibiscus
	•	Any plant with mites, aphids, fungus
🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Don’t spray in full sunlight (leaf burn)❌ Don’t use more than 5–7 ml per liter❌ Don’t spray on very young seedlings❌ Don’t mix neem oil with chemical pesticides❌ Don’t use during heavy rain

Neem Khali
Use once every 30–45 days.
Neem khali is mainly for:
	•	Soil pest control (nematodes, soil fungus)
	•	Preventing root rot
	•	Improving soil quality
	•	Keeping insects away
🌱 How Much to Use
For 8–10 inch pots
	•	1–2 tablespoons
For 12–14 inch pots
	•	2–3 tablespoons
For Grow bags (12–15 inch)
	•	3–4 tablespoons
How to Apply
	•	Mix gently in the top 1–2 inches of soil
	•	Water lightly afterwards
⭐ Best Times to Use Neem Khali
	•	During repotting (mix into potting soil)
	•	At the beginning of summer
	•	When soil gets fungus or insects
	•	Before monsoon season (to prevent root rot)
💚 Where Neem Khali Works Best
Great for:
	•	Tomato
	•	Chilli
	•	Brinjal
	•	Bitter gourd, bottle gourd
	•	Rose
	•	Curry leaf
	•	Hibiscus
	•	All vegetable and flowering pots
🚫 Avoid This
❌ Don’t overuse (can slow plant growth if used too much)❌ Don’t apply to completely dry soil❌ Do not mix neem khali & mustard cake together on the same day (too strong)(Keep at least 10–15 days gap)

Epsom Salt Spray
Preventive routine (safe for healthy plants):
➡️ Use once every 30–45 days (1–1.5 months)
If your plant has deficiency signs:
Use once every 15 days for 2–3 sprays, then stop.
🔍 Signs Your Plant Needs Epsom Salt
	•	Leaves turning yellow between veins (interveinal chlorosis)
	•	Curling leaves
	•	Slow growth
	•	Flowers dropping
	•	Tomatoes/chillies with pale leaves
🧪 Correct Epsom Salt Spray Formula
For foliar spray (on leaves):
	•	1 tablespoon Epsom salt
	•	1 liter water
Mix till dissolved.
🎯 Spray only on leaves, both sides.🌙 Spray in the evening (not sunlight).
🌱 Plants That Benefit Most
	•	Tomato
	•	Chilli
	•	Brinjal
	•	Capsicum
	•	Roses
	•	Lemon plant
	•	Hibiscus
	•	All flowering plants
(Not very useful for leafy vegetables.)
🚫 Avoid These Mistakes
❌ Don’t mix Epsom salt spray with neem oil, fertilizer water, or any pesticide❌ Don’t spray every week (too much magnesium blocks calcium & potassium)❌ Don’t use on seedlings❌ Don’t pour in soil too frequently — spray is safer


Paecilomyces lilacinus
Use once every 30–45 days if your soil has nematode problems.
If nematodes are severe:➡️ Apply every 20–25 days for 2–3 rounds.
After the situation improves, switch to once every 2–3 months.

⭐ Best Time to Use
	•	Before planting new vegetables
	•	During repotting
	•	When plants show stunted growth, small roots, few white roots, or root knots
